# Getting started

## Overview

Once you did the [DietPi Installation](../user-guide_install) you could choose to install one or more [Optimised software](../user-optimised-software) items or run one of the [DietPi tools](../user-guide_tools).

## Initial start 

This will be the first screen displayed, and `dietpi-launcher` the first tool we recommend running.
