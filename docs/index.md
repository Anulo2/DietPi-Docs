## What is DietPi ?

DietPi it is a **highly optimised minimal Debian OS**. DietPi is extremely lightweight at its core, our images start at 400MB in size (3x lighter than 'Raspbian Lite'). With features of low process/memory footprint, DietPi allows you to get the maximum performance from your device.

## Easy to install popular software
You can **quickly and easily install popular software** ! All of them are **READY TO RUN** and optimised for your system, checkout [_DietPi Optimised Software_](user-optimised-software).

DietPi does everything for you, giving you more time to enjoy the software you need.

## What is supported ?
Check [_Supported SBC_](hardware-supported_sbc) page for recently supported list.

**_Note:_** “Supported” is not a guarantee. “Supported” implies a particular SBC is at a high level of software maturity, but has no intention to support all possible SBC functions.
